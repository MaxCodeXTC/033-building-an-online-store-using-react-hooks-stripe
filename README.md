# Building an CLIENT SIDE Online Store using React, Stripe, and the React Hooks API

## Episode 33 - Part 1 - Create-React-App, Stripe Integration, Basic Checkout

Today we will be kicking off the project by setting up Stripe Checkout, creating some products, and stubbing out a shopping cart in React. Then using hooks, we will connect to Stripe in React and be bale to make a call to Stripe Checkout where we can see the checkout form on Stripe.

This is part 1 of the series and will be continued!
